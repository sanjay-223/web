        A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by a connected computer through the computer's video card.

    <p>
Monitors are similar to TVs, but usually display information at a much higher resolution. Also, unlike televisions, monitors typically sit atop a desk rather than being mounted on a wall. A monitor is sometimes referred to as a screen, display, video display, video display terminal, video display unit, or video screen.
