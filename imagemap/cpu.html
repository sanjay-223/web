    <p>
        A Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is functionally the most important component of a computer system. Without a CPU, any computer is more or less non-functional. It is generally referred to as the ‘brain’ of the computer due to the vast number of functions it performs.

A CPU is essentially a hardware that performs functions related to input and output, processing and storage of data for a computer system. It is the main control center for all operations that happen in a computer system.
