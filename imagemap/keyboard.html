        A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer.

The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to frequently asked questions about the keyboard.

        Today, most keyboards are similar to each other but may be missing one or more of the sections mentioned earlier (e.g., the keypad). Where keyboards begin to differ the most is in their construction and design. Some keyboards are mechanical, while others use membrane keys.
